## Overview of Approach

The code in `index.js` demonstrates various data manipulation tasks using JavaScript array methods such as `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and more. Each task is implemented as a separate function or wrapped logic within a single `console.log` statement.

The basic exercises include iterating over arrays, transforming data, filtering, sorting, and mapping. These tasks are performed individually and logged to the console.

The advanced exercises require combining multiple tasks into a single `console.log` statement. These tasks involve more complex data manipulation, such as filtering, transforming, and aggregating data from arrays and objects.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

1. **Handling Empty or Invalid Data**: One challenge was handling empty or invalid data in the `products` array, particularly in the `price` property. I addressed this by checking for empty strings and NaN values before performing calculations or transformations.

2. **Understanding Array Methods**: Understanding the nuances of array methods like `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` was crucial. I overcame this challenge by referring to the documentation and practicing with small examples to gain a better understanding.

3. **Debugging**: Debugging was essential when encountering unexpected behavior or errors. I used `console.log` statements strategically to log intermediate results and identify any issues in the code.
